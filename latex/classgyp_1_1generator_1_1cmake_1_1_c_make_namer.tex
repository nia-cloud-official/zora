\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}Converts Gyp target names into CMake target names.

CMake requires that target names be globally unique. One way to ensure
this is to fully qualify the names of the targets. Unfortunately, this
ends up with all targets looking like "chrome_chrome_gyp_chrome" instead
of just "chrome". If this generator were only interested in building, it
would be possible to fully qualify all target names, then create
unqualified target names which depend on all qualified targets which
should have had that name. This is more or less what the 'make' generator
does with aliases. However, one goal of this generator is to create CMake
files for use with IDEs, and fully qualified names are not as user
friendly.

Since target name collision is rare, we do the above only when required.

Toolset variants are always qualified from the base, as this is required for
building. However, it also makes sense for an IDE, as it is possible for
defines to be different.
