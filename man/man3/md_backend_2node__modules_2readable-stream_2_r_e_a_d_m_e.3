This package is a mirror of the streams implementations in Node\&.js\&.
.PP
Full documentation may be found on the \fRNode\&.js website\fP\&.
.PP
If you want to guarantee a stable streams base, regardless of what version of Node you, or the users of your libraries are using, use \fBreadable-stream\fP \fIonly\fP and avoid the *'stream'* module in Node-core, for background see \fRthis blogpost\fP\&.
.PP
As of version 2\&.0\&.0 \fBreadable-stream\fP uses semantic versioning\&.
.SH "Version 3\&.x\&.x"
.PP
v3\&.x\&.x of \fRreadable-stream\fP is a cut from Node 10\&. This version supports Node 6, 8, and 10, as well as evergreen browsers, IE 11 and latest Safari\&. The breaking changes introduced by v3 are composed by the combined breaking changes in \fRNode v9\fP and \fRNode v10\fP, as follows:

.SH "Version 2\&.x\&.x"
.PP
v2\&.x\&.x of \fRreadable-stream\fP is a cut of the stream module from Node 8 (there have been no semver-major changes from Node 4 to 8)\&. This version supports all Node\&.js versions from 0\&.8, as well as evergreen browsers and IE 10 & 11\&.

.SH "Usage"
.PP
You can swap your `require('stream')` with `require('readable-stream')` without any changes, if you are just using one of the main classes and functions\&.
.PP
```js const { Readable, Writable, Transform, Duplex, pipeline, finished } = require('readable-stream') ````
.PP
Note that `require('stream')` will return `Stream`, while `require('readable-stream')` will return `Readable`\&. We discourage using whatever is exported directly, but rather use one of the properties as shown in the example above\&.
.SH "Streams Working Group"
.PP
`readable-stream` is maintained by the Streams Working Group, which oversees the development and maintenance of the Streams API within Node\&.js\&. The responsibilities of the Streams Working Group include:
.PP
