.PP
.PP
For the current list of WG members, see the project \fRREADME\&.md\fP\&.
.SS "Collaborators"
The readable-stream GitHub repository is maintained by the WG and additional Collaborators who are added by the WG on an ongoing basis\&.
.PP
Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made Collaborators and given commit-access to the project\&. These individuals are identified by the WG and their addition as Collaborators is discussed during the WG meeting\&.
.PP
\fINote:\fP If you make a significant contribution and are not considered for commit-access log an issue or contact a WG member directly and it will be brought up in the next WG meeting\&.
.PP
Modifications of the contents of the readable-stream repository are made on a collaborative basis\&. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project Collaborators\&. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full responsibility for the change\&. In the case of pull requests proposed by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required for sign-off\&. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators participate and there is disagreement around a particular modification\&. See \fIConsensus Seeking Process\fP below for further detail on the consensus model used for governance\&.
.PP
Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the WG for discussion by assigning the \fI\fBWG-agenda\fP\fP tag to a pull request or issue\&. The WG should serve as the final arbiter where required\&.
.PP
For the current list of Collaborators, see the project \fRREADME\&.md\fP\&.
.SS "WG Membership"
WG seats are not time-limited\&. There is no fixed size of the WG\&. However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently\&.
.PP
There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for WG membership beyond these rules\&.
.PP
The WG may add additional members to the WG by unanimous consensus\&.
.PP
A WG member may be removed from the WG by voluntary resignation, or by unanimous consensus of all other WG members\&.
.PP
Changes to WG membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be suggested as any other agenda item (see 'WG Meetings' below)\&.
.PP
If an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the full WG is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removal is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting\&. This is to ensure that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all membership decisions\&. If a WG member is unable to attend a meeting where a planned membership decision is being made, then their consent is assumed\&.
.PP
No more than 1/3 of the WG members may be affiliated with the same employer\&. If removal or resignation of a WG member, or a change of employment by a WG member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of the WG membership shares an employer, then the situation must be immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more WG members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s)\&.
.SS "WG Meetings"
The WG meets occasionally on a Google Hangout On Air\&. A designated moderator approved by the WG runs the meeting\&. Each meeting should be published to YouTube\&.
.PP
Items are added to the WG agenda that are considered contentious or are modifications of governance, contribution policy, WG membership, or release process\&.
.PP
The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches; that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger group of Collaborators\&.
.PP
Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue\&. Any Collaborator, WG member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding the \fI\fBWG-agenda\fP\fP tag to the issue\&.
.PP
Prior to each WG meeting the moderator will share the Agenda with members of the WG\&. WG members can add any items they like to the agenda at the beginning of each meeting\&. The moderator and the WG cannot veto or remove items\&.
.PP
The WG may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to participate in a non-voting capacity\&.
.PP
The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting\&.
.SS "Consensus Seeking Process"
The WG follows a \fRConsensus Seeking\fP decision-making model\&.
.PP
When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask 'Does anyone object?' as a final call for dissent from the consensus\&.
.PP
If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a WG member can call for either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting\&. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the WG or else the discussion will continue\&. Simple majority wins\&.
.PP
Note that changes to WG membership require a majority consensus\&. See 'WG Membership' above\&.
