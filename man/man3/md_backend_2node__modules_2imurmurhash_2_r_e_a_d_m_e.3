md_backend_2node__modules_2imurmurhash_2_r_e_a_d_m_e \- iMurmurHash\&.js 
.PP
An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on \fRGary Court's implementation\fP with \fRkazuyukitanimura's modifications\fP\&.
.PP
This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly\&. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing\&.
.SH "Installation"
.PP
To use iMurmurHash in the browser, \fRdownload the latest version\fP and include it as a script on your site\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash\&.min\&.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
.fi
.PP
.PP
.PP
.PP
To use iMurmurHash in Node\&.js, install the module using NPM:
.PP
.PP
.nf
npm install imurmurhash
.fi
.PP
.PP
Then simply include it in your scripts:
.PP
.PP
.nf
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
.fi
.PP
.SH "Quick Example"
.PP
.PP
.nf
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState\&.hash('more strings');
hashState\&.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState\&.hash('and')\&.hash('some')\&.hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState\&.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
.fi
.PP
.SH "Functions"
.PP
.SS "MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])"
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given \fIstring\fP and \fIseed\fP\&. \fISeed\fP must be a positive integer if provided\&. Calling this function without the \fRnew\fP keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset\&. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one\&. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use \fRnew\fP to create a new state object\&. For example:
.PP
.PP
.nf
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
\&.\&.\&.

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish\&. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects\&.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
.fi
.PP
.PP
Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases\&.
.PP
.PP
.SS "MurmurHash3\&.prototype\&.hash (string)"
Incrementally add \fIstring\fP to the hash\&. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to \fRresult()\fP\&. Returns \fRthis\fP so calls can be chained\&.
.PP
.PP
.SS "MurmurHash3\&.prototype\&.result ()"
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer\&. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object\&. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via \fRhash\fP\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string')\&.result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m\&.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m\&.hash(' test string')\&.result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
.fi
.PP
.PP
.PP
.SS "MurmurHash3\&.prototype\&.reset ([seed])"
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given \fIseed\fP (defaults to 0 like the constructor)\&. Returns \fRthis\fP so calls can be chained\&.
