.SH NAME
md_backend_2node__modules_2minipass-fetch_2_r_e_a_d_m_e \- minipass-fetch 
.PP
 An implementation of window\&.fetch in Node\&.js using Minipass streams
.PP
This is a fork (or more precisely, a reimplementation) of \fRnode-fetch\fP\&. All streams have been replaced with \fRminipass streams\fP\&.
.PP
The goal of this module is to stay in sync with the API presented by \fRnode-fetch\fP, with the exception of the streaming interface provided\&.
.SH "Why"
.PP
Minipass streams are faster and more deterministic in their timing contract than node-core streams, making them a better fit for many server-side use cases\&.
.SH "API"
.PP
See \fRnode-fetch\fP
.PP
Differences from \fRnode-fetch\fP (and, by extension, from the WhatWG Fetch specification):
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Returns \fRminipass\fP streams instead of node-core streams\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Supports the full set of \fRTLS Options that may be provided to \fRhttps\&.request()\fP\fP when making \fRhttps\fP requests\&.
