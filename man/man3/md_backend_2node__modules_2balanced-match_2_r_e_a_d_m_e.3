.SH NAME
md_backend_2node__modules_2balanced-match_2_r_e_a_d_m_e \- balanced-match 
.PP
 Match balanced string pairs, like \fR{\fP and \fR}\fP or \fR<b>\fP and \fR</b>\fP\&. Supports regular expressions as well!
.PP
\fR\fP \fR\fP
.PP
\fR\fP.SH "Example"
.PP
Get the first matching pair of braces:
.PP
.PP
.nf
var balanced = require('balanced\-match');

console\&.log(balanced('{', '}', 'pre{in{nested}}post'));
console\&.log(balanced('{', '}', 'pre{first}between{second}post'));
console\&.log(balanced(/\\s+\\{\\s+/, /\\s+\\}\\s+/, 'pre  {   in{nest}   }  post'));
.fi
.PP
.PP
The matches are:
.PP
.PP
.nf
$ node example\&.js
{ start: 3, end: 14, pre: 'pre', body: 'in{nested}', post: 'post' }
{ start: 3,
  end: 9,
  pre: 'pre',
  body: 'first',
  post: 'between{second}post' }
{ start: 3, end: 17, pre: 'pre', body: 'in{nest}', post: 'post' }
.fi
.PP
.SH "API"
.PP
.SS "var m = balanced(a, b, str)"
For the first non-nested matching pair of \fRa\fP and \fRb\fP in \fRstr\fP, return an object with those keys:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBstart\fP the index of the first match of \fRa\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBend\fP the index of the matching \fRb\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBpre\fP the preamble, \fRa\fP and \fRb\fP not included
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBbody\fP the match, \fRa\fP and \fRb\fP not included
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBpost\fP the postscript, \fRa\fP and \fRb\fP not included
.PP
.PP
If there's no match, \fRundefined\fP will be returned\&.
.PP
If the \fRstr\fP contains more \fRa\fP than \fRb\fP / there are unmatched pairs, the first match that was closed will be used\&. For example, \fR{{a}\fP will match `['{', 'a', '']\fRand\fP{a}}\fRwill match\fP['', 'a', '}']`\&.
.SS "var r = balanced\&.range(a, b, str)"
For the first non-nested matching pair of \fRa\fP and \fRb\fP in \fRstr\fP, return an array with indexes: \fR[ <a index>, <b index> ]\fP\&.
.PP
If there's no match, \fRundefined\fP will be returned\&.
.PP
If the \fRstr\fP contains more \fRa\fP than \fRb\fP / there are unmatched pairs, the first match that was closed will be used\&. For example, \fR{{a}\fP will match \fR[ 1, 3 ]\fP and \fR{a}}\fP will match \fR[0, 2]\fP\&.
.SH "Installation"
