.SS "Helper module for loading your native module's \fR\&.node\fP file"
This is a helper module for authors of Node\&.js native addon modules\&. It is basically the 'swiss army knife' of \fRrequire()\fPing your native module's \fR\&.node\fP file\&.
.PP
Throughout the course of Node's native addon history, addons have ended up being compiled in a variety of different places, depending on which build tool and which version of node was used\&. To make matters worse, now the \fRgyp\fP build tool can produce either a \fBRelease\fP or \fBDebug\fP build, each being built into different locations\&.
.PP
This module checks \fIall\fP the possible locations that a native addon would be built at, and returns the first one that loads successfully\&.
.SH "Installation"
.PP
Install with \fRnpm\fP:
.PP
.PP
.nf
 bash
$ npm install \-\-save bindings
.fi
.PP
.PP
Or add it to the \fR'dependencies'\fP section of your \fRpackage\&.json\fP file\&.
.SH "Example"
.PP
\fRrequire()\fPing the proper bindings file for the current node version, platform and architecture is as simple as:
.PP
.PP
.nf
 js
var bindings = require('bindings')('binding\&.node')

// Use your bindings defined in your C files
bindings\&.your_c_function()
.fi
.PP
.SH "Nice Error Output"
.PP
When the \fR\&.node\fP file could not be loaded, \fRnode-bindings\fP throws an Error with a nice error message telling you exactly what was tried\&. You can also check the \fRerr\&.tries\fP Array property\&.
.PP
.PP
.nf
